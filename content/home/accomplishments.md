  Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.

  Understanding whether a given product, program or intervention improves livelihoods is as important as it is challenging. While established impact evaluation techniques can provide credible evidence of impact, they can also be expensive and lack representativeness at scale because they require active survey-based data collection – often for a spatially clustered subset of beneficiaries. Building on encouraging research that uses mobile phone records (CDRs) in developing countries to predict household wealth, we test whether CDRs might offer a big data substitute for survey-based measures of food security and thus enable CDR-based impact evaluation. We use a World Food Programme emergency unconditional cash transfer in response to a severe drought in Haiti combined with CDRs from the dominant mobile network operator as the basis for this test. A conventional survey-based regression discontinuity evaluation of the transfer shows that it measurably improved food consumption, food security and dietary diversity outcomes of beneficiaries. With these benchmark impacts in hand, we then turn to machine learning to predict these outcomes using household CDRs. We are unable to predict these outcomes with any meaningful degree of accuracy. With noisy predicted outcomes, we are unable to replicate our conventional impact estimates. We conclude with a post-mortem discussion of our failure in this context and application to extract any real predictive content from CDRs. While these data clearly offer potent new insights about development processes and outcomes, appreciating their limitations in such applications is a critical prerequisite to tapping their full promise and possibilities as a novel data source.

  "The Effects of Local Market Concentration and International Competition on Firm Productivity: Evidence from Mexico".<br>

  Although market concentration is one of the main impediments to productivity growth globally, data constraints have limited its analysis to developed countries or cross-country studies based on definitions of market concentration across nations and industries. This paper takes advantage of a database that is unusual by developing-country standards by means of leveraging the richness of five rounds of the Mexican Manufacturing Census between 1994 and 2014. The data allow estimation of the effects of local industry concentration on productivity. The main results show that a decline by 10 points in the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (on a 0–100 scale), a measure of market concentration, explains an increase by 1 percent in the total factor productivity of revenue. Local industry concentration also has heterogeneous effects on productivity across industries, while its impact on productivity varies by level of exposure to international markets. The results here show that the effect of greater exposure to trade offsets and, in most cases, reverses the negative effects of local concentration on productivity. These results are robust to specifications based on the estimation of firm productivity using the panels of establishment data from the 2009 and 2014 rounds of the economic census, to controlling for a proxy of markups, and to the use of alternate indicators of local industry concentration.
