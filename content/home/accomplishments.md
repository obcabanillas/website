  Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study and find that the motivating empirical puzzle remains unsolved.

  Call Detail Records (CDRs) can reveal surprising details about mobile phone users' wealth when subject to machine learning techniques. The predictive power of these metadata has opened new frontiers of empirical analysis, particularly in developing countries. Can they identify potential beneficiaries of means-tested programs and thereby enhance targeting? Can they detect \textit{changes} in well-being well enough to use in impact evaluation? We address these questions using an emergency cash transfer program in Haiti. A conventional regression discontinuity-based impact evaluation using survey data shows positive impacts of the transfer on household food security and dietary diversity and provides the benchmark for testing a CDR-based evaluation alternative for the same cash transfer. We extract features from the CDR data and use them in machine learning models to replicate the targeting of the transfers and then substitute for the survey-based outcomes before re-estimating impact evaluation results. Predicted outcomes are too noisy to differentiate between targeted beneficiaries or to detect changes in food security, and the CDRs therefore fail as an alternative basis for either targeting or evaluation. In a postmortem, we identify likely causes of suspects in this prediction failure and discuss implications and limitations for predicting welfare outcomes using big data in poor countries.

  "The Effects of Local Market Concentration and International Competition on Firm Productivity: Evidence from Mexico".<br>
  <span class="article-metadata li-cite-author">  <span>With Rodriguez-Castelan, Lopez-Calva </span> </span>

  <a class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm" href="https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-9210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  PDF </a>

  Although market concentration is one of the main impediments to productivity growth globally, data constraints have limited its analysis to developed countries or cross-country studies based on definitions of market concentration across nations and industries. This paper takes advantage of a database that is unusual by developing-country standards by means of leveraging the richness of five rounds of the Mexican Manufacturing Census between 1994 and 2014. The data allow estimation of the effects of local industry concentration on productivity. The main results show that a decline by 10 points in the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (on a 0â€“100 scale), a measure of market concentration, explains an increase by 1 percent in the total factor productivity of revenue. Local industry concentration also has heterogeneous effects on productivity across industries, while its impact on productivity varies by level of exposure to international markets. The results here show that the effect of greater exposure to trade offsets and, in most cases, reverses the negative effects of local concentration on productivity. These results are robust to specifications based on the estimation of firm productivity using the panels of establishment data from the 2009 and 2014 rounds of the economic census, to controlling for a proxy of markups, and to the use of alternate indicators of local industry concentration.
