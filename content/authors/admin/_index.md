I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis.

My research combines high frequency administrative data with traditional household surveys to explore the daily financial lives of the poor. 

In my Job Market Paper, I exploit cellphone transactions data to identify heterogeneous responses to access a digital credit product that finances cellphone expenditure. I find evidence poorer customers use loans to relax binding liquidity constraints, whereas non-poor customers use these loans for convenience.  

My other paper study how we can use high frequency data to identify vulnerable households, and the how big data has limits when we try to target specific groups.
